2,">> LORRAINE HUNTER: [4:21:46] Hi, this is Lorraine Hunter. I'm a resident of the city of Atlanta in DeKalb County. And I'm calling in opposition to passing the ordinance that will allow the building of a police and fire training facility in the area where a forest now exists where the old people used to be and the surrounding area. I think one thing that so many of the usual environmental protected practices or research has been done in this particular case. There had been reports already that the land is already contaminated with [indiscernible] for instance, and the waterways in Kentucky. And the land it has great plans for becoming carbon neutral in saving the environment. And again, on paper, this facility will destroy lumbering thing. And we're creating a situation where you have things like explosion and fine regions and all kinds of things that would create America more toxic environmental pollution and danger. And anything that's there at this point, we need to have clean up the area and develop it and the green stays in place it can be. I always knew that this facility is in response to that and immediate action to keep from taking crime is fairly ridiculous because it'll take years to actually pay. [4:23:43]",Sep_7_2021
3,">> MAN #35: [4:23:44] Hello, my name is [indiscernible]. I oppose the construction of a new police training facility on the ground of the old Atlanta prison farm because of first destroying the environment, all these trees would be cut down for what exactly? And also considering the location of the city of Atlanta and taking into account the future of the city of Atlanta and what could be enhanced, community and caring for the people as far as Atlanta County enhances security with the police. I oppose this motion of constructing of a training facility on the old Atlanta prison farm. Can find a training facility on the ground. Increasing time to me if I come back in time. I don't know why anyone could potentially from some of these communities. So, anyway, thank you again. Again, I oppose construction of a training facility on the old prison farm property. Thank you.

I actually live [indiscernible] and I was calling to express my grave concerns about the new police training facility that y'all are voting on. Please trade out acres and acres and acres of forest so that the police and other law enforcement. Agencies will have more space to practice doing that kind of thing which they have been doing for the last several years. Unfortunately, APD has not shown themselves to be trustworthy or particularly, interested in protecting protesters First Amendment rights to speak out against these things. And we already have so much to worry about in terms of climate change. And the impact of putting even one concrete in the middle of the city, which will create its own terrible problems. Moving forward, if you start seeing flooding might cause up and down Philadelphia and then from ecological perspective from a political perspective. And for me, in the public interest perspective, I don't want to say I agree she is completely against cop city. I think he will vote against it tonight. Thank you. [4:27:01]",Sep_7_2021

I have already called a couple of times, regarding the matter of the public safety training center, but I feel like this is my duty. And now I'm a resident of a gorgeous city. To call attention to the park, the building and the public safety training center I've been keeping an eye on and realizing that there's a lot of emotion involved, but I think these men and women they deserve a new public safety training center. And then everything has been done. The community has been spoken to. Just vote yes for what they said to me, to fight crime, get ready for what's going on and make this city what it's always been, a garden city. It comes together and done things for the right reasons. I urge you to do what's right and what's right is to vote yes. Vote yes on the public safety training center. Have a great afternoon. [4:28:54]",Sep_7_2021

You are known to listening to your constituents, a lot of your voters and especially the working class in the Atlanta community. So, please do the right thing.

I'm calling to oppose the proposal to lease public land to corporate funded Atlanta police foundation. This land should be used by the residents of surrounding neighborhoods in DeKalb County, not by cops. Supporters of this proposal make people think it is going to make our community safer, and it is simply not supported by facts. The cops, no matter their training, do not act. The police caused active and irreversible harm to our community and our neighborhoods, people like Rashad, [indiscernible]. The proposal by Joyce Sheppard is nothing, it is something kind of the mayor and city council addressing the real working-class people living in Atlanta. You must stop bending backwards to please foundations. You must address poverty, system inequality, public transportation, and lack of affordable housing. I'm calling in along other countless Atlantan's who opposes this proposal to demand that you reject it use the same precious resources in ways that will truly make up for people. Thank you.

As someone with up to two degrees in environmental health and a bachelor's degrees in environmental sciences, I can attest to that is pretty bad on all account. It's been done. [Indiscernible] And now without any process to work with people in the community area or getting any sort of input, your goal is to apparently respond to all of that without any kind of thought of what it would be, can be including there is no environmental impact assessment, and you're pressuring people to accept then voters come in. It's embarrassing, honestly [indiscernible] and the only good outcome here is if you vote no. Thank you. [4:32:48]",Sep_7_2021

I'm calling to encourage all city council members to vote no regards to building of a police training facility on Key Road. This has gone too far, you have not encouraged enough community involvement, you know that. And this cannot keep happening. You can vote yes on this but not with the city name. It will really ruin the land, it will ruin neighborhood, and account for [indiscernible] their own dime, not on the peoples' money. Vote no. [4:33:33]",Sep_7_2021

I live in the Northern Ridge district, and I completely oppose the proposal by Joyce Sheppard of leasing public land to privately-owned corporate funded Atlanta police foundation. I was in [indiscernible] and I did well in the police, and believe that the plan should not be used for more training than the cops have already in the city. I can tell from firsthand experiences and those my friends that there is no new training and this money needs to go toward the homeless and for education and mental health, addiction services, even the [indiscernible] service for those who can't get them, and transportation or anything like that, the money can go towards anything, but I strongly oppose cop city. I hope that you guys please take it from everyone. Please let that not to happen, seriously. The city does not need any more trauma, the city doesn't need any more victims. So, please vote no on the leasing of prison farm property. So, we don't want to add any more of that to the city. Thank you. [4:35:35]",Sep_7_2021

This should not be further for you securing our greatest little green space we have in Atlanta. And furthermore, there is no need for any more. We have a training center in Atlanta and we do not need more militarized training center. [Indiscernible]. So, I urge the council to vote against the proposal to site the training center on Atlanta old prison farm. It is a very useful city watershed that deserve environmental purpose and no good purpose we've doing but putting an industrial Atlanta training center. Thank you.

And I'm going to create a process that people can come to participate in, that means we've been rushing through and I also feel a bunch of misappropriation of city resources. We're in the middle of a global pandemic that's not getting any better. And people are in their home. Any money that you can spend on tearing down the forest and building the whole thing could be much better spent on any services that support people.

Our police and firemen need a city training facility. We had all of the year 2020, now our officers need to be trained better. This is an opportunity for them to have the facility. And other people are speaking on behalf of the environmental issues of the acreage and the layout. It’s actually going to conserve nature's plan and it has a lot of green space. It's going to be added and will be much better than what anyone is pontificating on building after that. The land has been empty for quite a while. In fact, I've seen the tenants going back and forth, to those in our position. Other people are calling from extensions, and not Atlanta residents. They really don't need to get a vote because they're not trying to spend as well. And this isn't an environmental issue to them because they're calling it a cop city. These are the same people they don't want police. And they are finding any way that they can bully and suppress the vote to go towards a training facility. I hope that our council is wise, and they don't fall prey to the propaganda that's being pushed their way. Thank you again. And please make a wise decision. [4:40:43]",Sep_7_2021

And I missed the point that I was not in favor of this, I think that this is actually a really bad idea. I think, the fact that the green space was city. I think it affects the residents and the community that [indiscernible]. The other part that I'm not happy about is I believe that we already have training facilities for the police.

26,">> AMY TAYLOR: [03:10:48] Hello again. I am Amy Taylor. I live on Key Road within 250ft of the development, and I am the resident representative of my community, Starlight Heights, on the Community Stakeholders Advisory Committee. I want to make it clear my comments today are my own, and I am only here as a representative of my community, not any organization or committee, including the CSAC. I am a property owner, just like the city of Atlanta. Unlike the city of Atlanta, I would not be allowed to set up surveillance and terrorize my neighborhood. This is my neighborhood you are making decisions about. And I'm already tired of living in a police occupation. Several of my neighbors and I have endured negative interactions with the police while walking on roads around the property, because we don't have sidewalks. As a resident of Key Road, I have been harassed, intimidated, interrogated, followed, and had to tell an officer to turn off his flashing blue lights at four in the morning because everybody else was trying to sleep. Of course, he was in his car sleeping just fine. An investigator was sent to my house to get my tag number for absolutely no reason other than I circled the property in my car, and took some pictures of the runoff of sediment from the property into Intrenchment Creek. Photos I have on a Google Drive, and I am happy to share with anybody else who wants to see them. They are horrific. And even after the silt fences were fixed and were in compliance, silt is still draining into Intrenchment Creek. The development is in violation of the Clean Water Act and I have photographic proof. [03:12:47] [03:12:48] --- [03:12:48] However, the courts, EPD and seemingly this council fail to acknowledge the environmental impact already taking place. Some opinions of the development believe the police presence will bring increased safety to my neighborhood. Currently, as APD guards the area around the property on public DeKalb property and out of their jurisdiction, drag racers continue to speed past my house and I hear gunfire all night long. Yet residents are harassed and interrogated for simply existing in public spaces. The police presence has not deterred the crime in my neighborhood. What it has brought is drama, violence, and a murder scandal. A few months ago, the mayor made a short visit to my neighborhood. He knocked on about ten to 15 doors and actually spoke to a fraction of those homeowners and renters. I sat him down in my front yard and had a discussion. I would like to present the council with the same questions I asked him. And I would like your answers today. Why is this property so special? Obviously, people want to keep the green space here. You can build or utilize another property. You cannot move the forest. Why not consider other location options? Where is the accountability? Why should I believe anything that has been done on the CSEC won't be changed or expanded upon once the dust settles and no one is no longer watching? What guarantee or compensation is in place for the residents of Starlite Heights and other residents who have invested their lives and savings into their homes? What happens if this development ruins our property values? We heard the promise of a green space before from Atlanta in 2017. What guarantee is there that this isn't another bait and switch for future police training development? [03:14:55]",June_5_P1

But I appreciate that our presence has kept officers off the street because maybe another Black person won't get killed today by the police. There are many White people who are trying to solve the problem, but you never see them going under the label of liberal. That White person that calls themselves a liberal, is the most dangerous thing in the entire Western Hemisphere. He's the most deceitful. He's like a fox. And a fox is always more dangerous in the forest than the wolf. You see what? The wolf. You know the wolf is coming. You know what the wolf is up to. But see what? The fox. He has his mouth shaped in such a way that you think it's a smile and you mistake him as a friend. Dustin Hillis and Matt Westmoreland are those White liberals that Malcolm X talked about. They're the White moderates that Doctor King talked about from the jail in Memphis, in Birmingham. Excuse me. Matt, I'll deal with you another day. Dustin, though, I ran against you in 2021 after you voted against the reimagining of the Atlanta Police Department under the legislation that Councilmember Antonio Brown introduced. That bill lost by one vote. You got on my list on that day. You also got on my list because I continue to have residents come p to me and talk about how you weaponize code enforcement to take their homes away, and you've given it to the Atlanta Police Foundation. And I want to be very clear. We know what you and your wife have been up to, and I'm sure there's a RICO racketeering case that's right here at city council and misuse of office. Sir, be clear. I have no intentions to run against you ever again. I have better things to do with my time. But I will make sure, because you introduced this legislation.

47,">> DAVID MARTIN: [06:35:40] Thank you for having me. My name is David Martin. I live in District 5. My hope is that the council votes no for the funding and ultimately for the project as a whole. Numerous reasons to oppose this project were discussed as nauseum during public comment on May 15th. However, I'm here to talk about why that public comment was inadequate. I'm here to talk about fiscal accountability. For almost two years, the delay sold to city taxpayers. And the deal I read about almost daily in the Atlanta Journal Constitution is that Cop City will cost city taxpayers $30 million, and the Atlanta Police Foundation, a private organization separate from the police department and city coffers, would pay the remaining 60 million of the $90 million project. On September 8th, 2021, Mayor Lance Bottoms stated, quote, ""The city's contribution will be through a 30 year, $1 million per year lease starting in fiscal year 2024, or a single contribution through a general obligation bond."" End quote. That $30 million number was repeated like gospel for two years. Following the public outcry on May 15th, Mayor Dickens ran an opinion piece on May 17th, again, spotlighting the city's $31 million contribution. On May 24th, the Atlanta Community Press Collective realized and published what select few have known for years, that the city taxpayers would actually be paying at least 67 million of the $90 million. Add the 10% elasticity clause plus $1 million gymnasium line, and this ballooned to 34 million. This chasm, in truth, was finally acknowledged by the mayor's office on May 26th. All of these hours of public comment and nobody stood up and told us the truth. As of Sunday morning, the Atlanta Police Foundation is still publishing on their website the city will only contribute $30 million. How far over budget? How much will the real cost be? Vote no. At a minimum, send the committee to examine the real cost. Thank you. [06:37:44]",June_5_P1

I don't consider them outside as someone who's technically outside. From the beginning of this, I still had my eyes on it because I understood chances are it's not just Georgia that's going to be training there. Chances are, the stuff I was seeing in the streets for 2020, for the BLM protests, I'm going to see even more difficult, even more bloody than before after this happens, because they're going to get better at it. I am under the impression that this community really doesn't fucking want it. And please, please. I only got two minutes. I only got two minutes. Please, I'm begging you.
