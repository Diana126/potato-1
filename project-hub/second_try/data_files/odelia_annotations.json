Atlanta fire rescue department is in dire need of a public safety training facility. Up to now Atlanta fire rescue team has been facing insufficient training facility. Atlanta did not have suitable fire training academy in over a decade designed to meet the least training requirements of our department, learning the community and state in danger. The value of a modern public safety training structure it's difficult to calculate because it's impossible for the value of human life. Saving lives is a volunteer journey, a reason to have fire department be prepared in a state of the art in cutting edge, voluntary public safety center. And since we know something about time experience of the same people condition. [Indiscernible] Atlanta fire rescue, the training they need to protect your community. Some of the benefits of having the structure is engineering fire training facilities, to name a few as follows, reduces the number of injuries and deaths of firefighters and citizens, reduces property damage and property loss [indiscernible], increased fire department efficiency, and improve the training capability of the fire department. For example, larger with more classrooms for dedicated firefighting. [Indiscernible] along with a training course instructing firefighting how to operate fire engine, firefighting appliances to include safely in and around the city of Atlanta. [Indiscernible] for repeated training exercises without taking tasks and equipment out of service in your community. Last but certainly not least, including the public image of the fire department.

I'm calling to renter my concerns due to the leasing of the former Atlanta prison farm property to the Atlanta Police Foundation for use as a military style training facility. It blows my mind that we have even talked about it. We can do so much better. And I am not against having a training facility, I find it absolutely absurd that the choice is being made to have it on top of a green space that could be the jewel in the heart of Howard in the Atlanta city that says so much about our values. In the Atlanta city here has been so much community that there has been so little interaction with the surrounding community. On this proposal, the legislation breaks a promise to Atlanta communities, ignores the commitment of the city of Atlanta and Atlanta City Council and the community as stated in the Atlantic City design, aspiring to the beloved community plan. The legislation allows the Atlanta Police Foundation to completely bypass public input and eliminate the need for City Council to consider alternatives and would obtain their goal. And certainly, much of this neglected corridor is being considered for a South River green space that works in plans and being slated for construction of zero public input. Alternatives for achieving the foundation goal exist if there is the will to pursue them. The negative impacts on residents and the natural environment to protect against highly impacted entrenchment necessary and avoidable. The green space and the environmental benefits in the form of Encroachment Creek cannot be replaced. And again, this reflects our values as a city. It is astounding to me that we're even considering that. We can do so much better. It could be a beautiful urban park having harry style exercises, with explosion. And [indiscernible] fire in a residential neighborhood it's beyond the pale. I urge you to put this matter to rest and prove against that. I encourage you to vote against this measure and retain the Atlanta prison public green space. Thank you. [2:12:40]",

    "text": ">> SIENNA EAGAR: [02:07:29] Good evening. My name is Sienna Eagar. I am a Georgia native. A Georgia State University student and a District 5 resident. I am no outside agitator, and I'm here today to urge City Council to vote no on funding for the supposed police training facility known as Cop City or at the very least, send it back to committee for reconsideration. When it comes to people living in the United States opposing police forces in the United States, there's no such thing as an outside agitator. We all live in the same country. We all live in the same state and in the same city. So we have all seen the violence inflicted upon our black, brown, queer and trans siblings and upon our planet. If what the city of Atlanta really wants is to keep us safe, you should know that spending $67 million of our tax dollars on the destruction of Weelaunee forest and the construction of Cop City will never be what keeps us safe. The destruction of one of the four lungs of Atlanta would be detrimental to the city, causing further pollution of the South River, flooding the already underprivileged surrounding communities and further dirtying the air we breathe. We are not separate from this planet. We are the animals who inhabit it. We are the natural world, and the natural world is here in City Hall, begging you to do what you can to save it. $67 million should instead be invested in resources that take care of people and truly keep us safe. Healthcare, affordable housing, mental healthcare, community resources, rehabilitation and reintegration programs instead of prisons are all necessary alternatives to Cop City and to policing as it stands and to prevent crime in the first place. In the event that intervention is required in the midst of an ongoing violent crime, a service providing effective, specialized, rapid response does not need to be connected to a policing system that has been failing our community since its conception. Peaceful protesters have been wrongfully charged and arrested for domestic terrorism. Peaceful activist has been wrongfully charged for charity fraud. Peaceful protester, Tortuguita, was wrongfully murdered with no one held accountable nearly six months later. All for nothing. Democracy is meant to serve the will of the majority, not just the will of those with capital and power. We who are in nature defending itself. We are the majority. Please show us that you are listening. [02:09:30]",
