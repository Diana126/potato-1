1,">>WILLIAM MARTIN: [01:57:18] Hello. My name is William Martin, and Atlanta is my home. I oppose the proposal by Joyce Shepherd to lease public land to privately-owned corporate funded Atlanta Police Foundation. DeKalb County not cops. After a year of cops brutalizing protesters standing up for racial injustice and against police violence and the death of [indiscernible] Books, it is known that the city not only voted to increase the police budget by 6%, but now intends to put more resources into policing and surveillance for this proposed facility. Cop academies do not keep people safe. This training facility will be used to train better violent repression tactics against Atlanta civilians, weapons exposing testing and dangerous shooting ranges. The fact that this forest used to be a prison farm underscores the connection between the legacy of slavery and modern day policing. [01:58:18]",Sep_8_2021
2,">> ELIZABETH GARDNER: [01:58:20] Hi. My name is Elizabeth Gardner, and I'd like to ask that you please vote no to building the police training facility on Key Road. Please vote no. Thank you. [01:58:32]",Sep_8_2021

4,">> MALE 30: [01:58:46] Hi. My name is [indiscernible]. I live in DeKalb County, and I'm calling to oppose the police training facility in the South River forest. I believe a police facility is going to have a significant negative environmental impact on the area with concerns, especially right now with flooding, Atlanta forests are really important as part of reducing water runoff. [indiscernible] I also think that the public process has not been allowed for input. In fact, here in DeKalb County, we've had no impact input on the police training facility, even though it greatly impacts our county. So again, I do urge that the council vote no against the police training facility and instead trying to build it into a park that everyone can use. Thank you. [02:00:16]",Sep_8_2021
5,">> FEMALE 31: [02:00:18] Hi. This is [indiscernible]. I'm calling from Sterling Heights neighborhood in unincorporated DeKalb County. I'm calling to urge the City Council to vote no to the police training facility on the Atlanta prison farm. We can believe that it has been an unfair burden and that it would be unwise for the city to take on the concept from scratch with the right community and racial things and, in a location that is better suited for that need. Because we do recommend that there are many. But this has unfortunately not gone well with the local residents. And we are not there to have the burden put on to us.

7,>> MALE 31: [02:02:00] Do what is right for the city of Atlanta. Show some courage and pass the Atlanta police for the public safety training center at Key Road. Police officers are currently going to John Clean House to intimidate people who are trying to stand up for the right thing as leaders. You all can send a strong message that we do not tolerate crime in the city. Please do the right thing and be courageous. [01:58:29],Sep_8_2021
8,">> FEMALE 33: [02:02:32] Hi. My name is [indiscernible], and I live in Zone 2. And I'm really hoping that you did not table this again. The citizens are suffering immensely because of the current climate against police officers, and nobody does this year. The money has already been raised privately, and it's not fair that our officers are training in a facility [indiscernible]. They have been mistreated for a very long time. And citizens deserve good trained officers. So, please do not do this to citizens anymore. Please allow our officers to have a nice facility to train in. Thank you. [02:03:19]",Sep_8_2021

20,">> ABBY: [02:08:50] Hi, my name is Abby. I'm calling to give a public comment about the proposed public safety training facility, proposed by Joyce Shepherd. I have several concerns about the proposed facility. First of all, I'm concerned about the environmental impact of destroying such a large part of our forest.

22,">> GLORIA TATUM: [03:38:28] Good evening. I'm Gloria Tatum, and I live in DeKalb County, and I'm not an outside agitator. But I am an activist reporter, and I have written over 30 articles about Black men who have been murdered by the police for minor violations or for no reason at all. Remember Anthony Hill? He was mentally ill. He was running down the street naked, needed help. Police killed him. Then we have Ray Brooks who was asleep in his car at Wendy's and he just wanted to go home, but the police killed him. Ahmaud Arbery was murdered while he was jogging in a bronze suite Georgia neighborhood by a former police officer. Then Manuel Tortuguita Teran, an environmentalist camping in a public park was shot 57 times because he didn't want to leave the park by six Georgia State Patrol officers. This is wrong. Thousands of people are being killed each year by the police. Police have killed 254 people so far this year, and Black people are more likely to experience deadly police encounters. The police don't need more training. They need reform, they need accountability, and we do not need a school for assassins. If you are worried about crime in this city, and you have to have a Cop City because you are so worried about crime in Buckhead, then you need to look at the state government across the street that has flooded the streets with AR-15s and other weapons of war with no background checks, no permits, open carry, and public Republicans have increased crime with their stupid gun laws.

26,">> JAMIE LOCHNER: [03:40:56] I oppose the Atlanta Police training facility that we call Cop City. Unlike my eloquent fellows, I'm not here to appeal to your consciousness, those who still have them of course. Instead, I'm here today asking that you'll allow yourselves to take a political out. That's what you have here, and political out you don't have to approve this additional funding. You can cancel this hot potato Cop City on the grounds of rejecting this additional funding. Do so. I really don't care what excuses you use. You can declaim your antagonism to us, and still vote against more funding for Cop City. Please do so. My reason to oppose Cop City is clear to me, and it goes beyond tearing down a vital Atlanta Forest or installing Cop City undemocratically in a poor Black neighborhood. It is because Atlanta policing is already brutal, I've suffered it, and it is too militarized, and the plans for this training facility seem custom designed to further militarize Atlanta's already far too blood thirsty police. To me, the facilities are part and parcel of Atlanta's decision makers abandonment of poor and everyday people here by repeatedly placing the mere desires and wish lists of the city's wealthy and corporations above all the needs of the rest of us. Simply vote against it. Don't raise the funding. Stop Cop City. That's what we need. That's what we're asking. Make any excuse you want. [03:42:53]",May_15_P2

My name is Avery, and I am a Christian minister as well as a transgender person. My wife and I moved to Decatur in 2019, and we plan to make this area our home for the foreseeable future, possibly our whole lives if its beauty is not destroyed for short-term profit. I want to share the story of my favorite biblical prophet Amos. Amos was a shepherd who tended to sycamore trees. So, you could say he is a tree protector, or even a forest defender. Amos had no desire to be a prophet, but God called to him. The truth had to be spoken by someone, and Amos like all the wonderful people here today, could not ignore the call. Amos lived in Judah, but he was called north to Israel to deliver his message. The rich and the powerful elite were harming god's most vulnerable children as well as the land. Where animals could have thrived, they had summer homes. With the money they should have paid their workers with, they had fancy clothes and jewels. Now the leaders of Israel hated what Amos had to say. Who was he to come up from Judah to speak to them? He was an outside agitator in their eyes. So, the king told him, ""Get out of here. The land cannot bear your words."" But the king was wrong. It was not words that the land could not bear, it was the leader's actions. They were the ones who caused the people and the land to cry out, but they'd rather blame the outside agitator, so God had Amos predict a reckoning. Doom would come unless they took this slim chance to make things right. I hope you will make things right. [03:45:10]",May_15_P2

31,">> LORRAINE FONTANA: [03:45:24] Hello everybody. I live in Atlanta in DeKalb County. Amir Farooqi is my representative to the council, but I'm going to address this to everybody. I think you've already read it or seen it, Amir. I hope that you all will reconsider your support for continuing to go forward with this corporate-sponsored destruction of a large part of the South River Forest, which I'm afraid has already been well underway. I'm asking you to consider what happened between 2017 when the city and a document titled Atlanta City Design, the south of a forest was called the Lungs of Atlanta, and considered that the land would be held as park land in perpetuity. And in 2021 when this council okayed leasing that land to the Atlanta Police Foundation for a new public safety training center, what caused the city government to change course so drastically from protecting our city's lungs to allowing the destruction of those lungs for the building of Cop City? Well what happened was the summer of 2020, and the national as well as local uprisings in response of the police murder of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and those of Richard Brooks and Armed Arbery here in Georgia. It's beyond ironic that anger at racist homicides by police, and want to be police, is responded to with plans for more policing using the same methods that have been used by training police here in Atlanta until now. [03:47:22] [03:47:22] --- [03:47:24]",May_15_P2
32,">> LORRAINE FONTANA: [03:47:24] That the police felt unfairly targeted, held sick outs, and lobbied for more people and perks is even more ironic. It's not surprising to me that the corporate-funded APF would push for more police in attempt to protect their property interests and encourage more corporations moving in to take over Atlanta at the expense of so many being pushed out of a city they could no longer afford to live in. Rather than putting money into solving the causes of criminal behavior, most of which clearly revolve around the growing income inequality in our country and poverty, and that's epitomized by the super income disparity in Atlanta that we all know from the studies that have been done, the city of Atlanta is doubling down on kowtowing to big business and the police lobby by billing them a multimillion dollar training resort with all the bells and whistles of the militarization of policing that's been happening in our country. But you have a chance to put a stop to the further degradation of the true idea of public safety by at least stopping that money being put millions being put into the city budget for Cop City. Even better, why not listen to the attorneys who say that the agreement entered into policing the land to the APF can in fact be broken under the contract terms by the mayor and asking him to do just that, and put an immediate halt to the destruction underway in the forest, which got me and probably a lot of other people crying when we saw the pictures of what's already happened. And how many of our tree and other plant and animal cousins and relatives have been destroyed already? [03:49:36] [03:49:36] --- [03:49:44]",May_15_P2
33,">> LORRAINE FONTANA: [03:49:44] Brother John Lewis was my congressional representative. I was always so glad and proud of that. I think he would be ashamed of what's happening today, especially of those wealthy and powerful Black elected officials who have insisted that $33 million be used to build a militarized police academy. Yeah, he would be ashamed of the situation of Atlanta in terms of poverty, in terms of the low-wage jobs without savings for people who can't afford to live in Atlanta anymore, who have to move out of Atlanta. He'd be ashamed that our law enforcement system has stooped to bring politically motivated unconstitutional charges of domestic terrorism against activists in an attempt to squelch others from speaking out against the building of Cop City, which have been partially successful. He'd be ashamed that the city of Atlanta's partners with the state patrol who they know are the only police force that doesn't use body cams, and put them in front of the charge into clearing a forest so nobody can see what right is going to happen right in front of their eyes and what they're going to do. He'd be ashamed that a 26-year-old activist whose autopsy shows he was sitting should they were sitting on the ground with hands raised in front of their body was gunned down like that. He'd be ashamed to be in this city. He also would be ashamed, I feel, of the people on this council who heard, a couple years ago, 17 hours or more of public comment, 70% of which were against this process, and it went forward anyway with granting that lease. And you'd be ashamed again if he heard and saw how many people came again and again and again to city council this year opposing this and trying to appeal to you all and giving reasons to appeal without any response from the people who reelected to the council.

34,">> LORRAINE FONTANA: [03:52:12] I think he'd be ashamed of the sham task force that the mayor has appointed, which is set up to rubber stamp anything that he and the APF wants to do. That at first he wasn't going to even let be a public thing that we were going to exhibit a secret meetings, and it had to be forced to at least say we can see what's happening, although we couldn't even on a zoom make comments. But every little bit has to be fought for. I think John Lewis would be ashamed of the continued flaunting of environmental standards and agreements and the halting of measuring system designed to protect the environment. Oh, we can't afford to do that right now or some reason why we're not doing that. He would be ashamed unfortunately of his replacement, I think, because Sister Nikema Williams has not spoken out in a good way. The only thing she said is, ""Well, it's going to be built so we better try to make it a good place for better training."" She's called out the property violence by some activists, but not the police violence. [03:53:27]",May_15_P2

Y'all still sitting these seats, eyes closed, don't hear nothing, don't see nothing, and I am fed up with it. You have senior citizens that I went served yesterday.

Y'all got college students homeless. Y'all could turn off this mic. You want to when my voice is loud. These people are homeless. We are about to be put on the streets, and y'all worrying about building something else. Where's this HUD money? Y'all sending that over there to bill too. We need help in our communities, and I've been telling y'all all this for so long. You will not silence me. You might put me out of my community by I keep blackballing me, but you won't silence me. You will not have me living like an animal, because that's how the majority of these people live, like animals. Think about these young children. Y'all want to stop crying? Stop putting their parents out on the streets. Y'all want to stop gangs? Stop putting the families on the streets. Maybe they can get some home training from their parents.

So, please pay attention and I hope you guys are all paying attention too, because we are all Atlanta. I was working in Midtown in the fall when two former FBI agents who later told me that they, one of which is the police chief of Cobb County, became my guest. Our conversation began talking about my art as I'd done with many others that day. When I went to show them my Instagram, they caught a glimpse of an anti-cop city post on my feed. After misogynistically commenting on what I was wearing in my photos and making vocal about if they could take me home, they went on to ridicule the anti-cop city movement. I took this opportunity to navigate a difficult subject by picking their perspective. Being law enforcement, I wanted to garner their understanding from the horse's mouth. They had a lot of nasty things to say about protestors, which as an American protesting is the American way straight back to the Boston Tea Party. As a person who has traveled seven countries and seen how others live, I have a firm belief we can do better in America, therefore we must do better. Protesting is one of the most patriotic things we can do. So, a law enforcement agent professionally using rhetoric to deter and implant distaste is manipulative, misinformation at its best, and frighteningly dangerous to the American propensity for growth at its worst. That's honestly the point of this. American cops are dangerous, violent, egregious and corrupt. The boys in blue are the biggest gang in America. [03:57:36] [03:57:36] --- [03:57:43]",May_15_P2

I'm here not only as a resident of this city, but as the project lead to a multidisciplinary arts movement called the Astor Project, where musicians, filmmakers, writers, muralists have come together to collaborate with 20 families who've lost a loved one to police violence in the state of Georgia. And we're going to rehumanize their stories through the power of art. And so when I was planning on what I was going to say, I went to the Atlanta Police Foundation website, and I want to read a portion of their mission statement. It says, the Public Safety Training Center will set a national standard, this is so good, a national standard for community engagement and neighborhood sensitivity and devotion to the civil rights of all citizens by law enforcement.

Police said that Jabril Robinson fired a gun at them, so they shot him in the back of the head while he was running away. That was a lie. Police said Jarvis Benjamin, whose mother spoke to you earlier today, physically attacked Officer Lin Thomas before he shot him in the chest. That was a lie. Police said that they didn't know children were in the car when they performed an illegal pit maneuver, killing 12-year old in Boykins. That was a lie. They did know. Police claim DeAndre Phillips drug an officer hanging halfway out of his car before he shot him. That was a lie. Police claim Jimmy Atchison committed armed robbery and that he had a violent and aggressive history with law enforcement. That was a lie. Police said they were ambushed by gunfire in the Weelaunee forest before they riddled his body with how many? [01:50:14]",June_5_P2

55,">> MACY THOMPSON: [01:50:19] 57. I think we all know that was a lie. You can't expect trust from the exact community you are continuing to brutalize. People much more informed than I am, much more experienced than I am have told you all the facts. No one on this council can claim ignorance. We know this, you know this. And honestly, that would have been your most face saving reason to vote yes, but you can't claim that anymore. So I'm going to end with this. We all have someone, and if we're lucky enough, we have some people whom we love so much, they feel like an actual extension of our hearts. Think of who that person is to you. And while you do, I want to remind you that Jarvis Benjamin was that person. His mother was here today, like I said. Did you know that he was an artist? He painted murals. He ran the sound system for his church. Did you know that Kevin Davis worked at a bike shop and took discarded bikes and put them back together and gave them to children in the neighborhood? Did you know that Andrew Smyrna was an entrepreneur, and he was on his way to get the keys to his first Airbnb property when he was shot and killed by police? Did you know that he loved music like his dad, who passed away last September? Devin Franklin, if I may quote him, he's not here, he said, a budget is a moral document. It reflects where your priorities lie. So I want to make sure that when you make this decision, you don't get the luxury of these names being in your distant memory. They're not statistics. They're not hashtag justice for, fill in the blank. There's somebody's person. And so are the eventual lives that will be lost if Cop City is built.
