I want to commented on the proposal there's no understanding for citizens to consider other uses of the publicly and especially publicly to you to be present before, which is really just, you know, further enhancing the connection between slavery and minority policing.

Tamika, my son, Linda, Angelo, who are standing in Louisville today for what would have been and what should have been Breonna Taylor's 30th birthday.

When I first heard that on the news, it made me think about the voter suppression, where you can't hand out water to voters and the voting lines. A lot of people have spoken. I'm going to shift my gear. I promise you, brother Lewis, Antonio Lewis. Councilman Lewis, I promise you. I had you on my spirit for I came here this morning. I saw you on the news and you were standing with the family. The family that many of us have supported. And you were saying, where are you all at? And I know we got some comrades in common. I hear you on WA, okay. I got to say this to you, brother. In 1966 is when the first SWAT unit was created in LAPD. Do you know the definition of a SWAT member? It is a paramilitary officer. I'm telling this to your brothers. I see you in a lot of good places. You got to be armed with the truth. As soon as SWAT units were erected that militarized every police department that has one. A SWAT member is not only a paramilitary officer, but that paramilitary officer is armed with weaponry and strategy from the military, making it a militarized police department. Baby Bou Bou. Bou come on. I'm not just throwing up a T-shirt because I like this hideous picture of this 19-month-old toddler. I happen to lead the charge of this state's largest, most high profile demilitarization of police case where Habersham County blew up a toddler by throwing in a flash bang grenade, which at Cop City, I'm sure there's going to be plenty of that bombs going up.

So please, brother, please don't make that mistake again. A militarized training compound is exactly what this is. It's funny that that $36 million was an oversight. And I think what it was, what was it being called, a message blunder? Well, sending it back to committee is something that I definitely support. For those of you who don't have the courage to say, hey, I just want to stop it, but send it back to committee for your fiscal responsibility to your constituents. And no wonder the 36 million was an oversight because it totally dispels the mayors. Atlanta safety is our North star in the minimization of the police involvement in this compound. What do I mean? Because the 36 million, you guys are paying rent to the Police Foundation. I don't know any other connection to, but let me say this, please.

So, I keep my my ears all the way open. But it's also my job to sit on these guys and tell the stuff I'm seeing as well. So, a lot of misinformation have been told. And when we talk about how long I've been affected by 1990, when a hurricane happened in Miami, they drew people to Atlanta. The Atlanta Miami drove what happened. My mother was murdered in a war. Right there in Dixie Hill. Shot over 20 times. That man did 30 years in prison. He came home three years ago. He now works for the city somewhere. My grandmother told me she felt justice. One week ago, I had a niece, Bri’Asia Powell. One week ago. That's my niece. My dad married her grandmama. So, that's my niece. Her mom is my sister. And I'm telling you that she was shot. She is superstar. The community calls her a superstar because she better than everybody else. We know what just happened over there. So, we seen all this stuff is going on, and I'm telling you, I'm going to keep going even more because you say the courthouse the other day. Nobody showed up. She was in there by herself. A hundred shots fired, 76 bullets, three flash bang grenades after 90 shots were already fired. There was a comment by the police. Let's make sure he's already dead. They then drove him downstairs and left him there for eight hours. Officers have been charged. I made sure I didn't disrespect you at all. And we come from the same people. So let me get to a period like I did you. And so I would say the officers have been charged with over 13 felonies. She was an in by herself. She wasn't because my staff has made sure we've been with her every step of the way. We walk in with her every step of the way. I made sure I let you go to a period, and I must have been there every step of the way before we was on city council. And so I will say that I was there and I went into the courtroom with her, came not before court started. [04:33:10] [04:33:11] --- [04:33:11][0.0] And I was getting there as many times as I could, no matter how busy I was. This was a mother there by herself, Black woman. And we got the police. We got them down and we got him in court, you all. We typically don't get police officers to go to court charged. And so watching her by herself. And so me saying, hey, you all don't hear that about cell. That's a real thing. And so I thought why I bring up reason. I bring in a friend. Nobody said a name, said one person himself. We are lying to me because knew we had found a way to sanity. We found a way to make sure she was okay. We found a way to make sure I'm okay. Now they tell me they got a fine new place to live because it's very dangerous where they live. And so over 100 shots were fired at their Mays High School. Nobody talked about it. So, I will let you know I'm fully engaged with all this stuff, but I'm listening to her about it, too.

I'm standing before you all as an example in the end results of the culture, as well as the studious outrage of justice when it applies to law enforcement. Again, to me, being a mother of a son who lost his life at the hands of law enforcement, my tone with this is the pettiness of distinguishing militarized as opposed to public safety and all the above. My thing is, with this whole issue of Cop City, I am not a negative cop. I come from a family that's enforced with law enforcement. My brother in law worked for the Secret Service. One actually work for the military police. And one also in law enforcement in my local time. I am a resident here of the metro Atlanta area. What I will say is my thoughts on Cop City is all of this money is being put into a structure, into a building, into entity, whereas we have the issues of community issues, homelessness. Prior to losing my son, I was a part of a lot of those organizations that was reaching out to the families that live in the communities where it has presently been gentrified, where you had elderly people put out on the street not knowing where they're going to go, not knowing where they're going to live.

Before I start, I just want to address something that I've heard over and over again from Councilman Bond, which is that the City Council simply cannot do anything to help the city, whether it be in education or transport or housing or whatever. I'm so sick of this narrative. The City Council is the only lawmaking body in the city. Yet at the same time, you just keep insisting to us that you are useless. Okay? [00:36:31]",June_5_P2

I'm a 19-year old resident of District 5, just a ten-minute drive from the South River forest. I attend college at Brown University, where I study sociology and urban studies on a pre-law track. I am here today to urge you-all to vote no on the $60 plus million in funding for Cop City, or at the very least, to send the legislation back to committee for further deliberation. I believe this is in all of our collective, including each of your best interests. Since the last time we did this on May 15th, my fellow student organizers and I have met with several of you individually to discuss this issue. Those of you that would meet with us at least had two major takeaways from these meetings. Firstly, you are not abolitionists. You will never be abolitionists. We cannot convince you to be abolitionist, and we will never agree about this until the day you-all die. [00:37:38]",June_5_P2
44,>> AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [00:37:40] [laughing]. [00:37:40],June_5_P2
45,">> GARRETT BRANDT: [00:37:40] This makes sense. After all, your jobs do directly depend on the existence of police in the prison industrial complex in order to legitimize and protect your power. But that's okay. I've come to terms with that. I know I cannot convince you that we do not need a new training facility. No matter how much scholarly research I cite about policing and effectiveness, no matter how much personal testimony I give, no matter how many necks or snaps, how many skulls are cracked, how much blood is spilled. What I want to focus on is my second takeaway. My second takeaway is that at least according to what many of you have told us directly, is that we actually agree on a number of things. In general, it would seem that we agree about the horrific environmental consequences the construction of Cop City would entail. As you have heard over and over again, this is a textbook case of environmental racism in action, a critical green space in an under-resourced, unrepresented, predominantly black community being destroyed for a facility which would train those who throughout the history of this country have only existed to harass, intimidate, and murder black people. Let us not forget that the origins of our modern police lie in the slave patrols of places like the city and state we all call home today. Let us not forget that the Atlanta Police Department is the very same department which brutally beaten and unjustly arrested civil rights demonstrators decades ago. Does that sound familiar? Let us not forget that for this nation and city's entire history, black people have been purposefully and systematically denied access to property and public green space. Look no further than the construction of Atlanta's highways. Make no mistake, Atlanta's legacy is one of stark racial environmental apartheid. That's a legacy each and every one of you joins if you decide it is okay to destroy the only public park serving a community full of black children in favor of shooting ranges and bomb test sites designed to spill those same children's blood. For those of you with black constituencies, I'm sure that's not a legacy you're interested in. Nobody will remember the shooting ranges, but they sure as hell will remember the force that got raised. Even if environmental racism is of no concern to you, if you represent somewhere full of happy white people like, I don't know, Buckhead, I'm sure we can agree that in this time of climate crisis, because we all believe in climate change, right, guys? Cutting down one of our city's four lungs is a terrible idea. I know some of you are old, but I want a planet to live on in 30 years. [00:39:59]",June_5_P2

It's yours and your parents and their parents before them. So please help us fix it. If you so desperately must have your Cop City, if you so desperately must facilitate the deaths of black people in this city, too busy to hate, at least do not massacre the planet alongside us. The next point of general agreement I found from meeting with some of you is our mutual disdain for the Atlanta Police Foundation. I have heard it directly from multiple of your mouths that there was no love from any of you for the APF. Good. Me neither. Let's make something clear. The use of the word Atlanta in APFs name is a severe misnomer. Forty percent of their members do not even live within the city. Forty five percent of the ones who do live in Buckhead that speaks for itself only four of them live in majority black census tracts. Dave Wilkinson himself lives an hour outside of the city.

They clearly cannot be trusted to represent Atlanta and you-all don't even like them. So I'm confused why you bark and roll over at their command. The answer some of you have given me to this question, is that it is simply easier to let the APF oversee the construction of the facility, especially given its location outside of your jurisdiction. President Shipman, you explicitly described this as a, ''deal of convenience.'' Why do you settle for convenience? We did not elect any of you out of convenience. Voting in the state sure as hell is not convenient. We elected you expecting excellence. You can do better than this. We've shown you it is important to us that you do so. If you absolutely must build a facility, do it without the APFs involvement. The final point of agreement I think we have is in terms of the suppression of activists by the police and state. Although I'm not sure why bother to differentiate between the two. From what I have heard from those of you I've spoken with, it seems we can agree that the use of domestic terrorism charges on peaceful protests are just horrifically excessive. It seems we can agree that the murder of Tortuguita should not have happened, that the 57 bullets that ripped their body apart should never have been fired. I'm sure we can agree that the SWAT raid of the tear down house and arrest of the three Solidarity Fund organizers is questionable at the very best. Although I would without a doubt label it as an attempt at fascism. If these things trouble you as deeply as you claim, why do you wish to build a massive playground for the people doing them? What do you think they will be training for? They've shown you quite clearly again and again you cannot train the police not to repress activists. That's what they exist to do. It's time to stand on your words and help ensure (phonetic) never happens again. I guess I did end up trying to convince you of something abolitionists. And I guess you just can't avoid talking about something when you're right. What I want to leave you with is a choice. I want to quote Matt Westmoreland, who told me he always strives to, ''vote his conscience.'' This is a choice of conscience. You can choose to do the easy thing. Take the APFs deal of convenience and vote yes. If that's what you decide, you'll continue to hear from us on Election Day and otherwise, I promise you that. Or you can choose to do the right thing, vote no or at the very least, send this tragedy of a legislation back to committee so we can have some modicum of trust that you care about us and will listen to our concerns. We've done what you want. We followed the proper civil process, no matter how difficult it has been made for us, and Lord knows it has been. Now it's up to you to vote your conscience. Do the right thing. It'll be a whole lot worse for all of us if you don't. [00:43:57]",June_5_P2

58,">> DOUG SHIPMAN: [00:46:39] In the example of the Fulton County, it is fully municipalized, but it still collects the same amount of money as when it was performing service. So if you'd like to see an increase in mental health services, human services for individuals, the same type of energy and zeal that is being expressed here today and in this movement would be wise to apply for the county so that they can allocate more money to spend on those services. Absolutely. [00:47:14]",June_5_P2
