And that same day, Amy Saint Pierre, who opposed Cop City and organized against it, tragically lost her life. Instead of responding to the Midtown shooting tragedy with action that we know works, proven gun safety measures and a true investment in the care our communities need, like affordable housing, my mayor, Andre Dickens, released an op-ed in support of Cop City, doubling down on his insistence to pour $67 million of taxpayer money to militarize our police and wage urban warfare against Atlantans. In that very same op-ed, he never once mentioned his plans to address gun violence, which is the number one killer of young people in this country, because doing so might alienate his friend, Governor Kemp. Just last week, we saw law enforcement weaponized to unlawfully raid and arrest organizers in our city for organizing a bail fund. Students from all of Atlanta's campuses and beyond are united in this. You've heard all of them here today. Cop City is only going to further harm our communities, not protect us.

Instead of staying at home, I, like everyone else who signed up to give public comment, have waited for hours to demand that you put an end to this. To fund a projects like the police training facility will set a precedent of mistrust and violence that will affect my peers and me for the rest of our lives. In Cop City, they'll train school resource officers roles to go into schools like mine and brutalize my friends and peers. They won't protect us. Why? Because they never have. They couldn't protect us at Columbine in 1999. They couldn't protect us at Sandy hook in 2012. And they chose not to protect us in Uvalde last year. There have been more cops in our schools, and yet our schools have become anything but safe. Today, in fact, SROs are the fastest growing sector of law enforcement in our country. Yet when kids my age are killing each other and killing themselves in rising numbers, we don't ask for cops. We ask for funding, for counselling, and for our communities. But you-all do not care about that. I did not have to come here today because it's not my duty as a youth to protect myself. It is yours.

And two, you are condemning us. You are killing us. Council, I would like to remind you that your choices have permanence. That when I am your age and you are senile, this facility, should it be built, will still be training killers. I really want to go home now. So thank you for your time. And I love you, dad.

    "text": ">> MAURA WOODS: [04:27:42] Thank you. My name is Maura Woods. I'm a former student of DeKalb Public Schools and a 20-year old resident of DeKalb County. I'm also a student organizer with the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition. Andre Dickens said that this is the year of the youth. So here we are. As the largest multiracial youth coalition in the state and as Atlanta residents inheriting the climate that's been targeted today, we echo demands to stop Cop City and divest from the violence police inflict on our communities. The decision to construct Cop City, a tool of genocide and white supremacy, is representative of a grave injustice, both in terms of racial equality and environmental preservation within the community where I grew up and live right now. The Weelaunee Forest has played a crucial role in preventing flooding, preserving the soil and providing shade during heat waves. These essential functions become even more critical as we face the intensifying effects of climate change. By removing this natural buffer, we are putting our communities, black and brown communities, indigenous peoples, disabled folks like me who are disproportionately targeted and impacted by state sanctioned violence at greater risk and further compromising the resilience of our city. It is imperative that we recognize the importance of environmental conservation and prioritize the long term well-being of our communities. By establishing a training facility of this magnitude, you are not only perpetuating the cycle of police militarization and urban warfare, you are declaring war against us. You are actively saying that we do not deserve safety, that we are not deserving of community, of home and safety in and inside of school. You are saying that we are wrong for daring to disrupt and make noise about what we feel and know. By encroaching upon Weelaunee, we are not only contributing to the destruction of valuable ecosystems, but also exacerbating the very issues that Cop City claims to address. We are living in a world, of course, and you-all are at the helm. Thank you. [04:29:37]",

    "text": ">> ANDREW VESILI: [04:29:57] Hello. I'm Andrew Vesili. I'm a resident of Old Fourth Ward, District 2. I graduated from Georgia Tech a decade ago, and last time I was here on May 15th, I spoke to you about how my friend Scout was killed on Georgia Tech's campus by police. Unfortunately, today I have another black mark to share about Georgia Tech's behavior. Recently, they censored a student journalist who used the phrase Cop City. On the same week, they honored a CNN journalist for social coverage. Now, maybe Cop City isn't the best name. Maybe Georgia Tech has something there because I think it gives the wrong impression. I think it makes it sound like what we're disagreeing about. What we need to argue with you about is the future of policing. Now, maybe we do disagree on that, but I think that's the wrong dimension to talk about right now. The reason people feel frustrated and ignored is because that's not really what needs to be said to convince you. So I'm going to give you some alternative names to Cop City. That'll be at the end. But first, let's start with the question. Why did we start this private public partnership to make this training center? I've heard it's because of cost. I've heard it's because those partners will help us in execution and with great planning. Let's talk about the cost. We are giving an enormous amount of land to a private organization for a $10 lease. And yet we have a lease back where we have to pay them an additional $1.2 million every year. I would like to motion that the city council buy me a house, and for that privilege, you pay me $1.2 million a year. Do I have a second? Do I have a second? Unfortunately, I don't have a second from a councilmember, so we'll just have to let that one go. We were told it was 30 million, then 33.5, then 67 million. When will it end? We were told that the private entity would raise 60 million in corporate funds. But have we seen them? Let's move on to planning. New York City has 32,000 police officers who are trained primarily on 32 acres. LAPD, 12,000 officers on 20 acres. Atlanta 2000 officers on 85 planned acres. But as we've heard today, 171 acres have been cleared. And that's what the permits are for. And over 300 acres are on the lease. That's 42 times more space by the low estimate, and 190 times more space per police officer than other cities need. That is like if you sent someone to get a single person bicycle and they came back to you with four full sized diesel yellow school busses, you would fire that person and we should fire our private partner in this matter. But why did we even want to privatize this vital function? For what benefit and for what cost? There's now less oversight. There's now less accountability. And in fact, that was the whole point. This allows there to be a shell game where this private partner can allow us to skirt around campaign finance laws, to skirt around oversight, to skirt around corporate donor transparency. Mayor Dickens, when speaking about the revenue generation of this proposed plan, said that 43 percent of the trainees would be from out of state. That doesn't even count that over 200 state police departments who might use these training services a single weekend course on a single skill is over $1,000 a person. Multiply that by the entire curriculum it needs to train a police officer by the hundreds and hundreds of police that will move through the system far across the land. Paramilitary organizations, private citizens. Who knows? Because we have a private partner who is running and who has built this facility. It will generate tens of millions of revenue each year, and that revenue will not go back to the city of Atlanta. It will go to a private organization, a 501 C3 that make no direct campaign contributions. And the keyword there is no direct contributions. It is the perfect craft because they can give contributions to their officers, to people who are in police unions, that are explicitly political organizations that can endorse and do endorse political candidates. And those people will receive grants and will be able to send that money to campaigns. So that's why we don't respond to arguments about how to improve policing. It's not about how to improve policing. It's about money. It's about how to sell out your constituents to make sure that you always have the campaign contributions you need. It is not a 30-year lease back. It's a 30-year self-dealing fund with interest. So let's think of different names for Cop City. Stop money laundering city. Stop corruption city. Stop Cop City. In my last minute, I would like to say one more suggestion for a name for Cop City. Domestic terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce. Now, is a tree house intimidating? Is a music festival a use of force? No. But is a SWAT raid on a bail fund a raid where the police officers were caught saying things such as, at some point they've got to give up. Especially if we're the one after all the money, it could just shut them down. When the police officers are quoted as saying, we've been putting pressure on them and attacking them from all different angles. Stop state terror city. Stop corruption city. Stop Cop City.

It really just disgusts me that our mayor claims this training facility is the accountability our communities demanded in 2020. And to destroy a forest that used to be a prison that used to be a plantation on land stolen from native people. In a city that's hot, in a city that floods, in a city with poor air quality, in a black neighborhood. A yes vote on this funding is blood on your hands that you do not want. If you vote yes, every person killed by a cop trained at this facility around the country is a murder you will help commit. Every protester shot in the skull by a rubber bullet. Every crowd that gets teargased, every child mistaken for a threat. And it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. Because if more training and more money made cops murder less, we would know by now. If you approve this funding, you are asking me, us to pay millions of dollars for our own surveillance, our own repression, our own murder. I live in Virginia Highland. Mr. Juan, I love our neighborhood so much. We have so many trees. It's beautiful. We have awesome green spaces. Green spaces that our neighbors in southeast Atlanta also deserve. I recently learned we only have these beautiful green spaces because some crazy hippies in the 70s occupied trees and protested a highway that would have run right through it. This type of activism is not new, but what is new is the level of violence that activists face. In fact, the only people harmed, killed during the fight to stop Cop City have been harmed at the hands of police. Alex Juan, if you believe in gay rights, trans rights, women's rights, if you believe in racial justice and people have the right to protest and defend their freedom, I want you to know that in a time where all those rights are under attack in our country, this is a training facility that will teach police to thwart, intimidate, kill, maim, terrorize people who should be protected by the First Amendment. Thank you. [04:38:17]",

    "text": ">> PAUL DEMERIT: [04:38:48] Okay. Hi. My name is Paul. I've lived in the city of Atlanta and inside the perimeter for 13 years now. I'm going to talk about another place where the tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money should go. I used to live and work in Councilman Hills' district, where I worked for a non-profit in Grove Park, a historically black and low income neighborhood that helped a lot of older legacy residents. I'll never forget seeing the inside of some of their houses when we would visit them. I saw a hole in the floor, black mold covering the walls, degraded HVAC systems if they even had a HVAC system in the middle of historic heat wave. And then I would drive just five minutes back to my house in Hills Park, where $700,000 were being built across the street. The never ending economic, racial, and environmental injustice in the city is the real violence we should be concerned about. Despite being separated by a few miles, a person living in English Avenue has a life expectancy of just under 64 years, whereas a Buckhead resident has a life expectancy of 87 years. That is 23 years of life lost. There's been a lot of people saying blood is on your hands, and it's probably annoying, but there's a reason for it. Their blood will be on your hands if you choose to perpetuate that state violence, perpetuate the years of lives lost by diverting money from programs that could fix that injustice to Cop City, which only serves to criminalize the victims of systemic inequality. Just look at the allies you have in your fight for Cop City. I get nauseous reading the city's pride announcements when you are on the side of Brian Kemp and Marjorie Taylor Greene. I'm a trans person, and Brian Kemp wants to destroy trans healthcare, and Greene has said that trans people should, ''be beaten into the ground.'' You are on the side of people who want me and my friends dead. Those are the friends you'll have to keep if you continue to vote for Cop City. I don't want to hear you quote okay or talk about the history of Atlanta civil rights when you support the imprisonment of people and labelling of activists as domestic terrorists for exercising their civil rights and putting them in jails that are so inhumane that a man was eaten alive by bedbugs in Fulton County Jail. Please don't make communities safer. Communities make communities safer. I yield my time. [04:41:03]",
