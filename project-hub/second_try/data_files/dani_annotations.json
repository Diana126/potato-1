I know that I know that I strongly oppose proposal by three separate to leave that public land to the Indiana Police Foundation and the land to be used in a way that serves the actual residents, county and Atlanta as opposed to the corporate interests. I think people are important. The foundation after an entire year, of protests surrounding, police brutality, and calls to defund the police. I think that it's inexcusable that city council is putting more and more parties and resources into the expansion of policing and surveillance in the city. You know, keep people safe and their investment in public services like health care, infrastructure, public health, education and being safe and people safe. I think it's time for mayor and city council to. Because these are real people in this incident. And then, the desires of corporations and this entire proposal has lacked democratic consent. There has been no real opportunity for public input. It's actually pretty embarrassing right now. An article in the American Foundation presented last week as public input. It was actually rather more of a captive power point, promoting pro-police propaganda. I think that city council is a real, real opportunity for the public to its employees to, provide a real opportunity for the public to express how they feel on this proposal, something that is actually accessible and allows people to express how they feel. I do not think Erica said. Listen, please stop corrupt city. No one said. Stop it. [7:38:59]",

I live in southwest Atlanta in Miss Overstreet's District, and I'm here to urge City Council to vote no on giving the Atlanta Police Foundation at least $67 million for the building of Cop City. From the very beginning, this project has been based on a lie. The lie that police make us safer, the lie that we live in a democracy, and the lie that more police training reduces police violence. Nothing could be further from the truth. Police in this country exist for one reason and one reason at all, and that is to maintain the existing inequalities that have existed in this society from the very beginning. They exist for the rich to oppress the poor, for White to oppress the Black, and for the rulers to oppress the ruled. The history of policing goes back to the slave patrols and to the Klan, and the same oppressive tactics that were once used to terrorize, enslave. And formerly enslaved Africans are still used today. The slave patrols used to racially profile Black people and ask them for their slave pass, and then confiscate their weapons and guns because they were scared of a slave rebellion. Today, NYPD and police departments of about the country stop and frisk mostly Black and Brown people and terrorize them. The actual commissioner of NYPD admitted that he is trying to instill fear in young Black male when he justified this practice. The Klan used to conduct night raids to terrorize Black people from exercising their right to vote and political power. Today GBI, a so-called law enforcement agency founded by the Klan, the civic person's name is Samuel Roper in 1946, to maintain White supremacy in the apartheid state of Georgia, it's still an apartheid state.

They were also involved in the Moore's Ford lynching of 1946, where eight Black people, right here in the state of Georgia, were viciously murdered by the Klan under the orders of then a newly elected governor, Governor Talmadge, who was looking to suppress the political power of Black people in the state. Not only that, but the GBI was involved in the biggest domestic terrorist incident in U.S. history, the Atlanta child murders. The Atlanta child murders were carried out by the Klan to start a race war in protest of school bussing according to the GBI own informant. The GBI did nothing for nearly four years and let the Klan terror reign in inner city Black communities from 1979 up until 1983. This resulted in the deaths of least 29 Black people, including 16 children. Their deaths are still unsolved to this day. The GBI and the FBI later pinned all these deaths on Wayne Williams, a Black man with virtually no evidence, in order to prevent a so-called race riot, i.e. Black rebellion. This project is also based on the idea that America is a democracy. But I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that if America was a democracy, then none of us would be here on Muscogee Creek land. [04:53:35] There will be no enslavement of Africans. Jim Crow, lynching of Black people, which still continues today by the men and women in blue. If we lived in a democracy, there would be no political prisoners who still languish in jail to this day. [04:53:54] [04:53:56] --- [04:53:56] There are nobody put any political assassinations of Doctor Martin Luther King, Fred Hampton Jr, and recently, Tortuguita. The reality is, is that we don't live in a democracy, and this is why we have militarized police to maintain the rule of White supremacy and capital. If we live in a true democracy, none of this process would ever be taking place right now, because the people of DeKalb County will be deciding what is best to do with the South River Forest. More training does not reduce police violence. The police are very well trained, and they are trained to oppress and oppress poor Black and Brown communities. And they do this with impunity and without restraint. Recently, I visited the Georgia Sea Islands and I learned about Roswell King. Who is Roswell King, you might ask? He was a brutal slave overseer and serial rapist of Black women. European visitors, when they visited the plantations of South Georgia, were shocked by the amount of mixed race people who existed on the plantation. He later went on to become a plantation owner within what is known as the city of Roswell. They named it after him. And he became a very prominent supporter of the Confederate war effort. Now who is one of the descendants of Mr. King? Governor Brian Kemp. You don't have to believe me. Just asked AJC. Governor Kemp. The person who has recently banned women's choice in the midst of rape, the top funder of the Atlanta Police Foundation, and dictator who prevented the defunding of police on a local level.",

Governor Kemp is more right-wing than Donald Trump. I don't think there's any Trump supporters in here. Hopefully not. But just be clear that when you are siding with Cop City, you are siding with fascism. [04:55:57] [04:56:07] --- [04:56:07] Finally, this project is based upon genocide and fraud, the genocide being the brutal murder of indigenous forest defender Tortuguita by the definitions of the United Nations, whose killing is reminiscent of the wholesale genocide of native peoples to so-called build this country, just like Atlanta City Council wants to build this cop playground. And the fraud being the fact that Atlanta officials have lied for nearly two years about the cost. City council, if I offer you a coconut smile for $0.99 for two years straight, and then come around and say, oh, it's actually $20.99. You all will probably send the GBI to my house to conduct a raid. [04:56:55]",

I used to work as a teacher but there's not as much enthusiastic funding for education, so I ended up leaving that line of work. And on the note of education, a lot of people have talked about misinformation, disinformation today. A great way to fight that is transparency. And I think that's something we've really not seen a lot of in this whole process. It's often very labyrinthian to try and even understand whether we can get back in the building once we've signed up. Just basic processes are very opaque. I also just wanted to say, based on the comments so far, I'm starting to get a sense that Atlanta might not be in the Cop City too much. It's like, I don't know, I didn't tally it, but I think it's like 64th note. No, it's just crazy. We have seen just such an amazing show out and I'm so proud of everyone. It's so great to see all of you and make all these connections will cause way more trouble now that we've all met each other. And I just wanted to double back on something I said in my previous comment, which is that the response to the Cop City Defend the Forest movement is alone in itself enough to convert you to the movement. The kinds of behavior we've seen is atrocious. I was in little five points near Freedom Park. And there was a protest, a march that was there was very peaceful. I guess technically they jaywalked at some point. I found this out because I got to watch a bunch of kids getting tased in Freedom Park. Real testament to the name of that place. And so, yeah, we've seen that these domestic terrorism charges and, like, I think we need to think in a state like Georgia, what will these tactics be used for. When abortion is illegal, what will these tactics be used for, right? What else are we going to see this used for? I just want to close by saying I'm Jewish and in Judaism there's a phrase, tikkun olam, which is the repairing of the world. And I want to say that, you-all don't just have an obligation but a lovely opportunity to do the right thing and help repair the world. Thank you so much. Defend the voice, stop Cop City.

So I'm an alumni of Georgia State University, and I'm also an organizer with the Georgia Working Families. I want to note, although he's not here anymore, that we've been canvasing in Antonio Lewis' district, District 12. And of the nearly 100 conversations that I've had, not a single person has supported Cop City. Many people don't know about it. It's another fun and deeply concerning fact. But most importantly, even more than canvasing and talking to my neighbors, I live merely four miles from the location of your proposed police fortress. And I'm here and all of the people are here to tell you that no matter what the corporate banker sells you, the people know that the budget is like a pie. And if the Atlanta Police Foundation is eating one third of our pie, one third of our budget, people are going hungry. And that's a metaphor. But it's also true, because, frankly, council members, teachers are going hungry. Those airport workers that you're widening the concourse for, they're going hungry. And also solidarity to the Delta strikers who are fighting for what they deserve, which is a livable wage. I want to move on to say that when you proposed spending $90 million, let's just be generous, to the private police foundation that's already eating a third of our pie, we have a problem. So there are people in this room who with the little slice that they have, are doing more for Atlanta than a policeman with a brand new take home car will ever do. [01:18:35]",

I'm also here with the Georgia Working Families. And as an organization, we believe our government should work for the many, not corporations and the elite few. Many of my fellow Atlantans have come here today with jaw dropping facts that more than prove that you should send this back to committee and/or straight up vote no to funding Cop City. That being said, I'd like to appeal to your humanity today. Police have already killed a protester in the push to build Cop City and charged 42 people with domestic terrorism for resisting Cop City. Giving more money to this project means you approve of the violence and intimidation against protesters. That has already happened. The old Atlanta prison farm, in fact, has a brutal history of violence and neglect against black and brown people, including jailing prominent civil rights activists like Stokely Carmichael. Building Cop City on its remains would only serve as a monument to that oppression. There has been very little oversight or transparency from the Atlanta Police Foundation. Giving them $67 million or more is irresponsible and unacceptable. Instead, you should be investing these resources in community services like the ones that we have illuminated today a million times. Many people don't trust all to act in their interests. The previous council ignored 12 hours of public comment expressing opposition to the project in 2021. And this is your opportunity to redeem yourselves with the people of Atlanta. You-all have the opportunity to stand up on the right side of history by listening to the people of Atlanta, rather than powerful corporations. This project doesn't need to go any further. Please stand with us and vote against funding Cop City. [01:20:59]",
