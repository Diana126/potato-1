1,">> MARY ROBISNSON: [07:52:03] Hi, my name is Mary Robinson. I'm calling with concerns over the proposed police training facility on Key Road. I'm a resident of the prison farm neighborhood, where the training facility is going to be build. I strongly oppose the proposed police training center for several reasons. The first being that Atlanta police already have nearly 100 acres elsewhere, that they should be using. [indiscernible] property slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding forest wetlands and the hundreds of species of animals that reside there. We find any part of these wetlands and woods that remain in our city as an explosion and negatively impact the efficiency of our natural floodplain as well as the climate. There isn't so much space available in the city of Atlanta itself. Rather than putting the farm on unincorporated DeKalb County because they can get away with that portion already sitting in the street. [indiscernible]. Thank you. [07:53:20]",Sep_8_2021
2,">> PRINCE WILLIAM WALTERS: [07:53:21] This is Prince William Walters, a homeowner in Gresham Park, and I'm calling to voice my disapproval of the training facility plan for the old Atlanta prison farm. This place should be used for much more public purposes, and I would very much appreciate you hear the voices of the community and our disapproval of the proposed new training facility in the Atlanta prison farm. We do not want this here. Homeowners have spoken, and we would very much appreciate more community minded use of such land. Thank you for your time. [07:54:03]",Sep_8_2021
3,">> EMILY JOHNSON: [07:54:04] Hi there. My name is Emily Johnson and I am a resident of Atlanta. I'm calling to express my extreme concern and condemnation of the proposed construction of 300 acres for a playground for cops. In the past year, your constituents, myself included, have been pleading with you to divest money from policing and invest in community programs. [indiscernible]. This proposed facility is a slap in the face in light of the Atlanta residents. Additionally, we are facing a warming climate and increased occurrence of natural disasters. To ensure Atlanta remains a resilient city, we must make sure that our green spaces are protected. The destruction of the forests would have extreme ecological impacts that would threaten the well-being of my community. I'm pleading with you to listen to the community and vote no on this plan.

I was a student at Georgia Tech, and then for about 15 years down here, in Salina, and now I live in Midtown. I'm calling to urge the entire council to vote no on the construction of the public training facility that is being proposed to be built on the old prison farm in the southeastern part of the city. I visited numerous that area and gone on some hikes. Also, with a group of friends and some scenic through there, you have a good time, and it's a nice little getaway from the rest of the city. And this is so much potential in that whole area to be another great part to the city and for generations to come. They think that I can potentially become an area where there are some regions that and the tearing down of the trees around there and it would take away from the potential that has to be become a major Park City.

I am calling to express my opposition on the proposal to lease the South River Forest in the old Atlanta prison farm as a police training facility. The Atlanta city design documents themselves pacify the South River Forest is going to be the keystone of Atlanta's future park in a greenspace. So, I don't know why we would not want to be careful planning unless it's an emergency and I don't see an emergency here. So, I think there's lots of other potential places for the training facility. It can go to industrial sites, strip malls, other places in Atlanta that they can make a facility like this. But there's only one work area. And, we believe that these overgrown trees that we're talking about here, that's irreplaceable. Let's keep the forest, and keep this training facility somewhere else. Thank you.

The facility will be used to train cops to better use violent suppression tactics against Atlanta civilians with explosives testing and dangerous shooting ranges. The fact that this forest used to be a prison farm underscores the connection between the legacy of slavery to modern day policing. City-wide elections are in November and voters are paying close attention to your vote on the cop academy and issues related to policing and incarceration. We're prepared to vote you out.

I'm trying to make sure that they're not running elsewhere, please. And for all that, there are plenty of empty parking lots, empty buildings, empty places that have already been built that you should preserve and replenish and renovate if you do want to do this expansion, but I'm obviously against cutting down trees and destroying history, something that is obviously a huge waste of money. You're better off starting all the positive things there to help those in poverty than needed to imprison those who are suing that have been put on probation come back on the $90 million figure. Not quite enough to figure this out. You can't wait to get on enforcement. You should get it for support and then you all have to be enforcement involved. Ya'll have a great day.

24,">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:42:44] Eight Minutes. Perfect. I'm not going to use all of it, but first of all, I'd like to thank everybody who's yielded their time to me, and I'll try to make good of it. I actually did know that Sean wasn't going to be here because we had stayed in line for several hours. I think I met him around 12:00 noon. I got here like 9:30, and he stayed until he had to leave because he had to pick up his kids. And that's a lot of people's stories. Even those who were able to make it could only stay for a certain amount of time, because we have other things going on. So, for those who are willing to stay all day, I haven't eaten since I left my house. To be here for this issue, that's how much it means to each and every one of us. And so to just get into it, I am in Akhil Gregory. I have been a resident of DeKalb County for the last five years. When I was staying in Atlanta, I was staying in East Lake. So, after leaving, I still was in the close proximity to the facility. So, when I found out about Cop coming about, it was more than alarming. So, what I can do is offer context to where this facility fits in the grand scheme of our nation's history. Not going so far back, but I'm just going to start three years back. So 2020, we had the largest protests in human history, and this was centered around stopping police brutality. So, what links people from New York to Atlanta to LA to people in Kenya, in Nigeria, and London and in the UK? Policing. This is not a particularly unique issue in Atlanta, but this next step in building Cop City is a real escalation in the matter and in the wrong direction, because what the mayor in the City Council offered in the wake of these protests were platitudes and promises.

25,">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:44:37] So, what that led to was the Rayshard Brooks bill, which, conveniently enough, the national situation became local for us when we saw another Black man be killed unnecessarily. And reimagining policing in the city of Atlanta. The only thing we're imagining right now is where that policy went. We're left here with a facility that is already behind schedule, over budget, and against the wishes of most of us. And it's also convenient to me how I've been listening to hearing since it started at 1:00. And so where did all the people or the facility go? They disappeared after 15 minutes.",June_5_P1

27,">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:45:20] Haven't heard one person since the first 15 minutes, but that's beside the point. Platitudes and promises. And then we get this. And so what do we have for it? We got a $30 million price tag. That's what the City Council is voting on today. We have heard the figure of 67 million thrown around. From my understanding, that's due to a leaseback policy where $1.2 million would be allocated for the next 30 years. So, that's more alarming. And if y'all were doing 67 million upfront, because not only can that increase, but also y'all are charging the next generation for this project. [05:46:00] [clapping]. [05:46:00]",June_5_P1
28,">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:46:01] When it comes to the land that this is built on, I've heard a lot about the environmental racism, and it's very true. But the element that alarms me the most is the previous use of the property, it was a prison farm. And so if you have this prison farm property and you have most of the land likely not remediated, then the clear-cutting of the forest is already putting the DeKalb residents in danger in the present. [05:46:23] [05:46:25] --- [05:46:25]",June_5_P1
29,">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:46:25] And so, I know people are throwing out a whole bunch of solutions to the matter. I don't have a whole lot of answers, but the first thing that needs to be done is restoring that forest. [05:46:33] [05:46:41] [clapping]. [05:46:41] When it comes to the methods that people use to protest, the fact of the matter is that a lot of people are going unheard, and we can check respectability politics all day and all that other mess. But the fact of the matter is, Tortuguita should be here today. The same policing policies that we are trying to change are what led to his death. That is a direct tie. And so when we're talking today, now contextualizing everything. I think I heard some mess about crime rate, crime rate, crime rate, crime rate. What happened in the last three years? Between March of 2020 and March of 2022, America lost a million people to COVID. This area, we lost thousands of residents to COVID. I'm not even giving in to the rhetoric behind the crime rate, but I'm also understanding that none of us are right now. None of us. And so when we have already made our case known for changing the way policing is done in this city, why are we back here? And the manner in which this whole public comment was conducted was, if not intentionally disruptive, callous of the council. You all knew we were coming. You all knew we were coming. So, what's the issue with the locked doors, the elevators not working, no water present? Going into how people found out if they're speaking. There are some folks who signed up to speak who are in the building, who didn't get the opportunity to speak because the doors were closed. [05:48:21] --- [05:48:21] And then you all took like an hour or so to be able to get the list out so people knew that they were coming up next. None of that is okay. And so moving forward, what does this mean? What happens next depends on you all. I am, as I said it, a DeKalb County resident. Had been for five years, but I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, where in June of last year, we had lost Jaylen Walker, a 25 years old, to dozens of police bullets in his back. Totally unnecessary. But police departments tend to think of each other like McDonald's and Wendy's rather than part of the same franchise. So, what I'm recognizing is that Cop City ties everything together, because now we don't get to just point out the local instances of police brutality in the future after voting for this. If you all were to do so, we're going to look at whether or not the officers were trained here. We will continue to hold you all accountable, whether or not you all listen to us today and just know that all the tactics that have been used to dissuade us will not work. Know that you all picked the wrong opportunity to pick this facility because people have been inside for the last three years. We outside now.",June_5_P1

34,">> JACK JOYNER: [05:50:15] Hello. My name is Jack Joyner, and I'm here to represent The Atlanta Justice Alliance. It is our great privilege to present a statement from our fellow activists Marlin Coutts, Savannah Peterson, and Adele McLean, the organizers of the ATL Solidarity Fund, who were cruelly and unlawfully arrested last Wednesday, May 31st, 2023. Marlon, what have presented these remarks themselves, but they contracted an illness while in jail. These are their words. Last Wednesday, we woke up to the sound of our front door being broken down. Dozens of police with assault weapons and SWAT equipment surrounded our home in DeKalb County, and threatened to throw a flash bang grenade into our living room. We, of course, surrendered peacefully and were taken to jail in our pajamas. It was a terrifying experience, which became even more surreal when we later learned the blatantly false charges offered by the police. We spent days in jail before a judge finally reviewed the allegations against us, and acknowledged that the charges were questionable at best. Our charitable organization is far from fraudulent. We fastidiously respect the boundaries of the law. But in Atlanta, in 2023, it seems that following the law is not enough to avoid being attacked by police. As we saw with the killing of Manuel Tortuguita Teran, there seems to be no limit to the violence police are willing to direct against those they see as political opposition. While sitting in jail, we learned that the timing of the attack on our home was carefully calculated for political effect. Statements by police confirmed that we were raided shortly before this very hearing, presumably to prevent us from participating or assisting activists whose rights were violated. [05:52:24] [05:52:25] --- [05:52:25] If the Atlanta Police and DeKalb DA Sheri Boston are strategically deploying violence against nonprofit organizations in order to interfere with public participation at city council hearings, what does that say about the state of democracy in Atlanta? We should note that this attack has harmed many more people than just us. Our nonprofit organization, Network for Strong Communities, does more than just provide legal aid for protesters. It also facilitates the distribution of thousands of pounds of fresh produce every week to communities in need in Atlanta. Because of these trumped up charges, our partners are now understandably scared to provide us food to distribute for fear of becoming Boston's next target. This campaign of intimidation is jeopardizing access to critical resources for some of the most vulnerable people in our city. Even though we are out of jail, we are still living in fear. This episode has shown us firsthand that no matter how civil our organizing, no matter how law abiding our activities, we are not safe in this city. This issue has become bigger than us and bigger even than Cop City. It is about whether anyone is safe in Atlanta when they dare to oppose the agenda of the Atlanta Police Department. If you want to upend this city's reputation as the birthplace of the civil rights movement, abuses of power to suppress protest cannot be tolerated. [05:54:15] [05:54:17] --- [05:54:17] If City council does not take a stand, the attacks and abuse by police and prosecutors will continue and escalate. How many more innocent people will be brutalized, jailed, even killed, all in the name of suppressing the city? This is no time to fix this. Know, really. It's a city which embraces protest, which by grassroots organizing. Do not vote Atlanta become a police state. Thank you. [05:54:43]",June_5_P1

I hope that your ears will be more open than they were at that time. Mr. Bond, thank you for coming back. My name is Mark Spencer. I'm not here representing any institution. But I'm simply a physician who lives and works in Atlanta. I do represent a coalition of health care workers and students who study the impact of policing on health. We're deeply concerned about the city's possible investment in Cop City. Before we dive in, first, I'd like to address the firefighters. We recognize the benefits you bring to communities, and we support your work. We know that police are not necessary for it. We urge you to unlink yourself from the Atlanta Police Foundation and the Atlanta Police Department. Stop supporting a wildly unpopular and harmful project, and we will support you in obtaining a fire specific training center, not in the middle of a forest. When we talk about what enables healthy individuals and communities, the most important component are politically determined. It's not medicines. It's not surgeries or lab tests, but the investments made in rooms like this that make up over 80% of health outcomes. We strongly oppose Cop City in the South River Forest, or anywhere for that matter, simply because the costs are too high. The environmental, the health, the financial, the safety and the opportunity costs. In a city defined by profound racialized inequality, investments are needed urgently elsewhere. Here's what we know based on decades of public health evidence. Policing is rarely preventative. It is largely unrelated to crime rates, and any marginal safety benefit is far outweighed by the opportunity costs and direct consequences. This includes over 1,000 people murdered annually and over 75,000 visits to the emergency room from police violence every year. This also includes the damaging effects on health from the jails that the police fill. Just like a new jail or more jail space will not undo the harms of incarceration, a new cop city will not change the harms of policing. It does not matter if the morale is high, if pay is high, how training is done, or where training is done, if you give them a car or not, because policing is still policing, what we know is policing is the discretionary enforcement of some laws in some places against mostly poor people, their state sanctioned violence. Policing relies on criminalization, which we know negatively impacts the physical and mental health of individuals, their families, their children, and their communities. [05:58:19] --- [05:58:19] Criminalization is not about care, but a way of sorting who matters and who doesn't. Additionally, experiencing arrests lowers democratic participation. At a time, Atlanta faces a democratic crisis, with less than 20% of eligible voters filling the city council in front of us. It is clear that too many people do not see electoral politics as a way to materially improve their lives. In part, this is because they do not feel that you are listening. We cannot have healthy communities without healthy democracy.",June_5_P1
39,">> AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [05:58:58] [clapping]. [05:58:58] The only proven way to decrease police violence is to decrease interactions with the public. As health care workers, we want to be clear. We want alternatives to police, not rebranded police. We want alternative specialized responses, not call responses. We want non-police traffic enforcement. We want harm reduction, not the criminalization of our patients for substance use. [05:59:22]",June_5_P1

For example, it is great that the city is committing $55,000 to the transgender community. However, Atlanta is committing $18 million to its correctional budget that should not exist. This is over 300 times the investment. These $18 million belong to the John Lewis Center for Freedom and Equity, a promise broken by this council.",June_5_P1

So I think I'd rather just address something because everyone has already said what you needed to hear before I got up here. But I'd like to address something that was said by someone on the council who will remain unnamed about being a fiduciary for the city. A fiduciary is, it involves trust, especially with regard to the relationship between a trustee and a beneficiary.

And for those of you that may not have friends or family that lost their lives due to the police, due to the prisons, you may think otherwise, but most people in Atlanta know that the police aren't working for our public safety. We don't see that. So to call Cop City a Public Safety Training Center sounds like lies. And I think it was sold to you as lies. It was misrepresented to you.

47,">> MAY COLIN: [06:59:14] I'm Colin May. I used to live in Atlanta. I live near Atlanta. It's still my city. I'm pretty sure that this training facility is unique. It's not something that's been tried before. It's experimental. And the thing about an experiment is that you use an experiment to gather data to find out whether the thing is worth doing and whether it's worth scaling up. So the idea of scaling it up before it's even started or before it has kind of started. The idea of putting public funds to increase something which has only shown to be a failure so far is just absurd. How hard is it to guess what's going to happen when you divert public funds to a project which there's overwhelming opposition to and has already caused a great deal of harm and is destined to cause a great deal of more harm. You know that it's going to fail. You know that this fake city isn't going to be a great help to training police officers. And it's just not going to happen. And so when I think why are you even considering to divert public funds to a thing which only causes harm and which is so overwhelmingly opposed, it seems like you just want to cause chaos. It seems like that's what voting for. [07:01:18]",June_5_P2

51,">> ROYCE MANN: [07:01:39] Hi members of council, Council President Shipman. As many of you know, my name is Royce Mann. I want to thank each of the councilmembers who met with myself and other members of the multi school coalition against Cop City to take a deep dive into the legislation. What we see is the harmful effects of it and look at ways that we can work together. We are about to vote forward, building a police training facility on the site where somebody was killed by the police. I don't feel like we have really settled with the absurdity of that. We are about to build a massive police training facility where somebody was literally killed by the Georgia State Patrol, who may have access to these facilities for peacefully protesting these facilities. I need that to sit with you-all. I need you-all to let that sit in your souls and ruminate and get through all the talking points that you've been given by the APF and other stakeholders in this. Not what they have to say is an important, but we are trying to build a police training facility where someone's life was taken by the police. If we do that, we are not moving forward in a sustainable direction, in a direction where we can heal. We are moving forward in a direction where trust further deteriorates. Where the people of Atlanta continue to feel like their voices go unheard, while a select few hold all the power. I'm here because I care about democracy. I care about this city. I've called it my home my entire life. It pains me to see this process and how it's unfolding. It pains me to see so many people, myself included, feel that our real concerns, that our voices are not being heard. Thank you. [07:03:42]",June_5_P2

55,">> ADAM BRUNEL: [07:03:47] Good morning everyone. My name is Adam Brunel. I am for Cop City, no I'm not. No one is for Cop City, but none of us are. None of us are. So I know everyone is going to get some sleep so I just want to say a huge shout out to all the black Jews, Israeli Jews, all of the Jews of color who are not able to be here right now because it's 3:00 in the morning, much less for Tortuguita.[foreign].
