{"id": "1", "displayed_text": ">> MARY ROBISNSON: [07:52:03] Hi, my name is Mary Robinson. I'm calling with concerns over the proposed police training facility on Key Road. I'm a resident of the prison farm neighborhood, where the training facility is going to be build. I strongly oppose the proposed police training center for several reasons. The first being that Atlanta police already have nearly 100 acres elsewhere, that they should be using. [indiscernible] property slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding forest wetlands and the hundreds of species of animals that reside there. We find any part of these wetlands and woods that remain in our city as an explosion and negatively impact the efficiency of our natural floodplain as well as the climate. There isn't so much space available in the city of Atlanta itself. Rather than putting the farm on unincorporated DeKalb County because they can get away with that portion already sitting in the street. [indiscernible]. Thank you.
