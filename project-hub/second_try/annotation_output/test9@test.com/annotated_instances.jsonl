I don't have a whole lot of answers, but the first thing that needs to be done is restoring that forest. [05:46:33] [05:46:41] [clapping]. [05:46:41] When it comes to the methods that people use to protest, the fact of the matter is that a lot of people are going unheard, and we can check respectability politics all day and all that other mess. But the fact of the matter is, Tortuguita should be here today. The same policing policies that we are trying to change are what led to his death. That is a direct tie. And so when we're talking today, now contextualizing everything. I think I heard some mess about crime rate, crime rate, crime rate, crime rate. What happened in the last three years? Between March of 2020 and March of 2022, America lost a million people to COVID. This area, we lost thousands of residents to COVID. I'm not even giving in to the rhetoric behind the crime rate, but I'm also understanding that none of us are right now. None of us. And so when we have already made our case known for changing the way policing is done in this city, why are we back here? And the manner in which this whole public comment was conducted was, if not intentionally disruptive, callous of the council. You all knew we were coming. You all knew we were coming. So, what's the issue with the locked doors, the elevators not working, no water present? Going into how people found out if they're speaking. There are some folks who signed up to speak who are in the building, who didn't get the opportunity to speak because the doors were closed. [05:48:21] --- [05:48:21] And then you all took like an hour or so to be able to get the list out so people knew that they were coming up next. None of that is okay. And so moving forward, what does this mean? What happens next depends on you all. I am, as I said it, a DeKalb County resident. Had been for five years, but I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, where in June of last year, we had lost Jaylen Walker, a 25 years old, to dozens of police bullets in his back. Totally unnecessary. But police departments tend to think of each other like McDonald's and Wendy's rather than part of the same franchise. So, what I'm recognizing is that Cop City ties everything together, because now we don't get to just point out the local instances of police brutality in the future after voting for this. If you all were to do so, we're going to look at whether or not the officers were trained here. We will continue to hold you all accountable, whether or not you all listen to us today and just know that all the tactics that have been used to dissuade us will not work. Know that you all picked the wrong opportunity to pick this facility because people have been inside for the last three years.

I'm calling to express my extreme concern and condemnation of the proposed construction of 300 acres for a playground for cops. In the past year, your constituents, myself included, have been pleading with you to divest money from policing and invest in community programs. [indiscernible]. This proposed facility is a slap in the face in light of the Atlanta residents. Additionally, we are facing a warming climate and increased occurrence of natural disasters. To ensure Atlanta remains a resilient city, we must make sure that our green spaces are protected. The destruction of the forests would have extreme ecological impacts that would threaten the well-being of my community. I'm pleading with you to listen to the community and vote no on this plan.

{"id": "24", "displayed_text": ">> AKHIL MOSLEY: [05:42:44] Eight Minutes. Perfect. I'm not going to use all of it, but first of all, I'd like to thank everybody who's yielded their time to me, and I'll try to make good of it. I actually did know that Sean wasn't going to be here because we had stayed in line for several hours. I think I met him around 12:00 noon. I got here like 9:30, and he stayed until he had to leave because he had to pick up his kids. And that's a lot of people's stories. Even those who were able to make it could only stay for a certain amount of time, because we have other things going on. So, for those who are willing to stay all day, I haven't eaten since I left my house. To be here for this issue, that's how much it means to each and every one of us. And so to just get into it, I am in Akhil Gregory. I have been a resident of DeKalb County for the last five years. When I was staying in Atlanta, I was staying in East Lake. So, after leaving, I still was in the close proximity to the facility. So, when I found out about Cop coming about, it was more than alarming. So, what I can do is offer context to where this facility fits in the grand scheme of our nation's history. Not going so far back, but I'm just going to start three years back. So 2020, we had the largest protests in human history, and this was centered around stopping police brutality. So, what links people from New York to Atlanta to LA to people in Kenya, in Nigeria, and London and in the UK? Policing. This is not a particularly unique issue in Atlanta, but this next step in building Cop City is a real escalation in the matter and in the wrong direction, because what the mayor in the City Council offered in the wake of these protests were platitudes and promises.
